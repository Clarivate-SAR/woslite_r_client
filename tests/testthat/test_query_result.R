test_that("QueryID", {
  # tests for the property `QueryID` (integer)
  # The ID of the query that can be used for pagination.  Note: The id will expire after four hours (session duration) and during a session you can have maximum 2,500 Queries.  The QueryIDs will be reused (starting from 1) if more than 2,500 queries are requested within a session.  The session will expire after four hours inactivity,  i.e. no requests with the token.  Use always &#x60;x-paginate-by-query-id&#x60; Header to paginate through records. The response time will be faster by using QueryID.
